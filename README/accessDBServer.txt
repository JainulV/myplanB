Steps to follow to setup remote access to couchDB server.

instruction valid for unix based systems.

1) get the "somename.pem" key from admin.
2) change the permission of the ssh key above using "chmod 400 KEYNAME"
3) add key to /.ssh directory and wirte a ssh config file with:
    Host *.amazonaws.com
    IdentityFile <path to file eg: ~/.ssh/key.pem>
    User <get from admin>
4) enable port 5984 on you machine for remote access.
5) use the command "ssh -N -L 5984:127.0.0.1:5984 <public dns address of instance>". this gives one access to server via ssh tunnel. There will be nothing returned if all worked perfectly.
6) open a second terminal/shell and check to see if you're connect to instance using "curl http://127.0.0.1:5984" it will return couchDB version and some other details.
7) to make couchDB interaction with python script, install couchDB python library using "pip install couchdb".
8) you are now ready to interact with the couchDB server.
NOTE: close your connection to server by interrupting the shell using ctrl-c.
